 `FAEPlaybackEngine` manages the playback of audiobooks. Once playback is started, chapters will be played in order until the entire book is completed. The status of playback can be checked at any time with the `playerStatus` property, and the current chapter is provided by the method `[FAEPlaybackEngine currentLoadedChapter]`. The `FAEPlaybackEngine` also communicates the change of playback status via NSNotifications which are posted through the shared NSNotificationCenter. For more information on notifications, see the [Constants Page](../Constants.html)
 
 @note In the SDK, there is a concept of a "chapter". In AudioEngine, each chapter of an audiobook does not contain a "track number" or "playback order". Instead, chapters are organized as they were in the physical book: separated into several parts, with a collection of chapters therein. To identify a chapter, it is given a "part number" to designate the part of the book that it comes from, and a "chapter number" to designate the index of the chapter within the part. Books are downloaded and played back in part order, with each chapter being downloaded or played in order within the part. For example:
 
 ```
 chapters = [{"partNumber":1, "chapterNumber":1},
         {"partNumber":1, "chapterNumber":2},
         {"partNumber":2, "chapterNumber":1},
         {"partNumber":2, "chapterNumber":2},
         {"partNumber":2, "chapterNumber":3},
         {"partNumber":3, "chapterNumber":1}]; // A Sorted array of chapters
 ```
